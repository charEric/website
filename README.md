This is an extremely basic, personal website that is essentially going to be copypasta'd code, hosted on github pages. 

Domain provided by namecheap.

Theme templates provided by: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp

Will try and keep this fairly decently documented.

### Goal

The goal of this site? Not too sure yet, but I'd like to start documenting things that interest me, and am over social media.

We'll see how it goes...
